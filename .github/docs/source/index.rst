🙏 Special Thanks
------------------

A heartfelt thanks to `Team Yukki <https://github.com/TeamYukki>`_ for creating the original `YukkiMusicBot <https://github.com/TeamYukki/YukkiMusicBot>`_, which, although now inactive, served as the foundation for this project.  

A special thanks to `Pranav-Saraswat <https://github.com/Pranav-Saraswat>`_ for forking and reviving it as `YukkiMusicFork <https://github.com/Pranav-Saraswat/YukkiMusicFork>`_, making the bot functional again. However, **YukkiMusicFork** has since been deleted by Pranav.  

Our current project, `YukkiMusic <https://github.com/TheTeamVivek/YukkiMusic>`_, is an imported and further improved version of the now-deleted **YukkiMusicFork**.
